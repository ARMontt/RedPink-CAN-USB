# RedPink-CAN-USB

Mini PCB for STM32C09, useful for general purposes that involves mostly communication through a CANBUS to USB. This board helps to simplify development of industrial devices that requires CANBUS communication. 

## Motivation

Nowadays there are many CAN-USB or CAN-UART devices, that require external coding (usually in C) to test the communication, however, a more user-friendly interface accompanied by a simple CAN-USB device would improve the performance for developing new industrial devices.
